Hi, I am a quantitative sociologist from Kazakhstan. I am currently finishing my PhD at the University of Leipzig. Previously, I studied Sociology at Saint Petersburg State University (M.A.) and Philosophy at Kazakh National University (B.A.). Very broadly speaking, my interest is the application of various statistical methods to social data. I have a versatile statistical toolkit and I have worked on diverse projects. However, my special fondness is for network analysis.
