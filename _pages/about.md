Hi, this is my personal page. I am a quantitative sociologist from Kazakhstan. I am mostly interested in methodology, with a special fondness of network analysis. Also, I am passionate about rock climbing and drum'n'bass.

The picture to the right is totally unrelated. As you can see I was using a template to create this page and I am too lazy to remove the picture. Also, I don't have any picture of myself that is good enough to put instead.

I will eventually transform this site into a something more personal. I hope.
