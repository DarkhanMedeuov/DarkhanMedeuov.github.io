Hi, this is my personal page. I am a quantitative sociologist from Kazakhstan. I am mostly interested in methodology, with a special fondness of network analysis. Also, I am passionate about rock climbing and drum'n'bass.

Also, I have a Telegram channel called <b>[Chthonic Optimism](https://t.me/+GnDONZs1kTk0ODNi)</b>. It has 0 posts and 0 subscribers so far. There is a certain poetic justice to that, I think.
