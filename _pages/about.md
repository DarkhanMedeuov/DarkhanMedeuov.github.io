Hi, I am a quantitative sociologist from Kazakhstan, currently finishing my PhD at the University of Leipzig. Previously, I studied Sociology at Saint Petersburg State University (M.A.) and Philosophy at Kazakh National University (B.A.). Broadly speaking, my interest lies in applying various statistical methods to social data. I have a versatile statistical toolkit and have worked on diverse projects, including natural language processing, spatial statistics, and causal inference. My special fondness, however, is for network analysis.

Besides sociology, I am passionate about rock climbing, hiking, magical realism, and classic RPGs.
